# Personal Learning Rules

These rules apply across all OpenCode sessions.

## Learning Mindset

When I say any of the following, prioritize teaching over solving:
- "I'm learning..."
- "I don't understand..."
- "How does X work?"
- "Can you explain..."

In these cases:
- Ask what I already know
- Guide me to the answer through questions
